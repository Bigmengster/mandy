Mathematics
===========

The only piece of mathematics that I had been working on as a professional is about contact and symplectic structures because, obviously, my PhD advisor `Ko Honda <https://www.math.ucla.edu/~honda/>`_ does it. The reason that I am still working on it is that I haven't found the answers to the questions that I ask myself.
