Bypass attachment revisited
===========================

.. note::

    Work in progress

Bypass attachment is an operation introduced by K. Honda in [Hon99]_ to catch the most fundamental "phase changes" among a :math:`1`-parameter family of surfaces in a contact :math:`3`-manifold. It is in effect equivalent to E. Giroux's "bifurcations" of characteristic foliations studied in [Gir99]_. The difference between the two approaches, however, is that a bypass attachment is performed by really attaching a "bypass", which is a certain half-disk with Legendrian boundary, to the surface, while a bifurcation of vector field is an abstract phenomenon that can most likely only be observed and difficult to find if we have something specific in mind. Indeed, there exist tools such as the "imbalance principle" from [Hon99]_ and the "bypass sliding" (aka. "bypass rotation") from [Hon00]_  which are designed to find bypasses.

Although the generalization of Giroux's bifurcation to hypersurfaces in higher-dimensional contact manifolds is rather straightforward [#pi1_switch]_, at least under the assumption of characteristic foliations being Morse, how a higher-dimensional bypass should look like turns out to be less obvious. A rather ugly model of such a thing, called :math:`\Delta`, was worked out in [HH18]_ (Figure 7.2.3 on page 45): it's more-or-less a half-ball with certain Legendrian foliation inside and a partially Legendrian boundary. The reason :math:`\p \Delta` not being completely Legendrian was that I couldn't then make it smooth, even with corners. Basically you cannot have three Legendrian planes [#leg_plane]_ intersect like a corner between the walls in your room. This psychological barrier disappears when we think of a bypass as a coLegendrian. They are not meant to be smooth: they come with cone singularities. The rest of the article will be devoted to spelling out the details. It would be a bonus if the more elegant construction of higher-dimensional bypasses will lead to a better understanding of contact manifolds, but that is highly unclear at this point.

Bypass in Dimension :math:`3`

We start by reviewing the definition of a bypass in dimension :math:`3`.
