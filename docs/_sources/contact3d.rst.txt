What's a contact structure in dimension 3?
==========================================

We try to explain what a contact structure is in a 3-dimensional space from an intrinsic viewpoint, i.e., we pretend to live inside the contact 3-space without any knowledge of what an outside universe means. This article is heavily influenced by a `paper <https://www.ihes.fr/~gromov/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/carnot_caratheodory.pdf>`_ of M. Gromov.

Space and dimension
-------------------

Contact structure is a structure on a space. So let's first talk about spaces.

It may be either the choice of god or the perception of our kind that we all live in a space. Since the time we looked into the sky, the earth, or the ocean, we never stopped wondering, physically or mentally, about the mysterious space around us.

When talking about spaces, one of the first things that come to is the so-called *dimension*, or in more plain terms: how big is it? There is no universally agreed definition of what a dimension is. There really shouldn't be since any definition has to serve a particular purpose and no definition makes sense as a standalone. Here are two definitions of dimensions that are relevant to contact structures. 

Visual dimension -- Degrees of Freedom
	This way of defining diemsion is particularly fonded by physicists and engineers. Roughly speaking, it asks about in how many independent directions can one moves around. In this sense, we all seem to live in a 3-dimensional space since there are apparently 3 degrees of freedom: up :math:`\leftrightarrow` down, left :math:`\leftrightarrow` right, and forward :math:`\leftrightarrow` backward. 

Measure dimension -- Volume Growth
	The other, maybe less intuitive, way to define dimension is to ask how fast does the volume of a ball grow with the radius.
