# Mandy

This repo contains the source code to build this [Github-page](https://yhuang85.github.io/mandy/) which I use to document my hobby work: currently math and coding.

## Working enviroment and general tools
**Operating system:** [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)-Debian

**Text-Editor/IDE:** [Vim8](https://www.vim.org/)

## Webpage build tools
The Github page is served from the **docs** folder, which is automatically generated by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) - a software primarily designed for documenting Python projects and clearly abused by me. Details about the build can be found in the official [Sphinx tutorial](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/index.html). In particular, I heavily use [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) supported by Sphinx 4 for rendering math. My MathJax configurations can be found in **build-source/source/conf.py**, which actually hosts all Sphinx configurations. On top of Sphinx, I've made the following personal choices:

- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is used to manage Python packages.

- [Pydata-Sphinx-Theme](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme) is used to style the website. (I'm currently waiting for the theme to style common [ReST](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) directives [#454](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/issues/454#issue-980549092))

- Since Github page can only be rendered under certain path (I use **main/docs**), I followed suggestions in this [post](https://www.docslikecode.com/articles/github-pages-python-sphinx/) to organize folders in this repo.
