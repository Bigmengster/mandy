Coding
======

I started learning how to code in the summer of 2020 partially because I always think it's interesting and mysterious, but also because, more importantly, I need to survive a post-academia life. Given the fact that I've never opened a command line terminal before, I started learning coding with Python, following suggestions of a few friends. This was indeed a great choice and I learned all the basics from the internet. So I won't bother listing any learning resources here since there are just too easy to find. I later also spent time learning C++ and a bit of Java, and after a while, it has become quite obvious that being able to code and code well has very little to do with the specific choice of languages: they are merely tools to execute your logic. I guess ultimately it's logic that draws me into this rabbit hole. In any case, this section will be filled up by my experiences with coding for, hopefully, many years to come.
