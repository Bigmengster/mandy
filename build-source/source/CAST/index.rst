Mathematics
===========

The only piece of mathematics that I had been working on as a professional is about contact and symplectic structures because, obviously, my PhD advisor `Ko Honda <https://www.math.ucla.edu/~honda/>`_ does it. The reason that I am still working on it is that I haven't found the answers to the questions that I ask myself.

.. note::

    At the moment, I've been trying to migrate writings from my old wordpress `blog <https://yhuangmath.wordpress.com/>`_ to here. But I've also been occupied with new writings, if not other life events. In any case, this note will disappear once the migration is completed.
